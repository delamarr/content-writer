            <h4> How Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Future of Medicine </h4>
            
            <P> Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare in ways we never imagined. From diagnosing diseases faster to assisting in surgeries, AI is revolutionizing the medical field and improving patient Health outcomes. <br> <br> 

Let have a look at some of the biggest ways AI is changing medicine today.
</P> 

            <ol> 
                <li> <b>AI in Disease Diagnosis</b> </li>

                <p> AI-powered tools can analyze results from medical imaging, detect abnormalities, and diagnose diseases with high accuracy.
For example, Google’s DeepMind AI can identify eye diseases from retinal scans with 94% accuracy, helping doctors catch problems early. </p>
<ul>
    <b>Why It Matters:</b>
    <li> AI can detect diseases Faster than human doctors, leading to better treatment.</li>
    <li> Reduces misdiagnosis and human error.</li> <br> 
    <b> Examples in Use: </b>
    <li> AI-powered X-ray analysis for detecting lung cancer.</li>
    <li> Machine learning models predicting heart disease risk.</li>
                </ul>

                </span>

                <li> <b>AI-Powered Virtual Health Assistantss</b></li>

                <p>Imagine having a virtual doctor available 24/7! AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants help answer medical questions, remind patients to take medication, and even suggest treatments. </p> 
                <ul>
                    <b>	Why It Matters:</b>
                    <li>Provides time for prioritized cases and saves doctors’ time by handling common patient questions.</li>
                    <li>Provides Better health monitoring for patients at home.. </li> <br> 
                    <b>Examples in Use:</b>
                    <li> Ada Health App – Uses AI to analyze symptoms and suggest possible conditions. </li>
                    <li> IBM Watson Health – Helps doctors diagnose and create treatment plans. </li>
                </ul>
